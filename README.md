## Problem Description
Many businesses have ecommerce platforms so that customers can efficiently shop online. In order to promote their ecommerce platforms, businesses invest resources into marketing through various channels to attract customers. However, many shoppers or people in general, tend to visit ecommerce websites to browse, ultimately leaving without making a purchase. This sometimes results in a loss of resources for businesses as they are marketing to customer segments that are unlikely to make an online purchase.

## Objective
Our goal is to determine whether or not a shopper will end up purchasing something. This could help advertisers determine what kind of demographics to market to for the best results. Factors such as browser, day of week, and month of year could all have an impact. In this study, we create a model to determine, based on a set of factors, whether a customer will leave a website having made a purchase or not. We will also preprocess the dataset to maximize efficiency of our model and eliminate unnecessary features.


## Preliminary Background Research
We have identified a dataset in the UCI ML repository: 
Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/). It is associated with a paper, doi.org/10.1007/s00521-018-3523-0. The dataset contains info about the visitor (region, browser, OS, visitor type (e.g. returning)) and the context of the visit (if it is a holiday, what month the visit is happening in, etc.). 


## Deliverables (with Roadmap)
1. **Scientific/Contextual Description**: Understanding the various metrics utilized to assess online shoppers performance. Describe the situation in more depth of online shopper tendencies.
   - **Target Deadline**: Week 4 of the quarter

2. **Background Research**: How do existing models perform? Is there similar research in non-ML journals that we can use to learn about online shopping? Are there any current prediction models assessing online shoppers and how do they function? 
   - **Target Deadline**: Week 4 of the quarter

3. **Dataset Analysis**: Observe dataset in depth to understand the various categories; figure out which features to implement and how to correlate them. Preprocess data and clean it so we can apply and read from it efficiently.
   - **Target Deadline**: Week 5 of the quarter

4. **Model Development**: Train an accurate prediction model after understanding variability in dataset and decide which type of model (polynomial, linear, etc.); split our data into 80:20 ratio for training and testing; find another dataset relative to online shoppers performance we can perhaps clean to use as validation on our model that we develop.
   - **Target Deadline**: Week 7 of the quarter

5. **Web-based Front End**: Developed manually or through a software potentially where input data on online shoppers can be provided and a prediction is given
   - **Target Deadline**: Week 8 of the quarter

Our project aims to bridge the gap between browsing and purchasing on ecommerce platforms by leveraging data-driven insights. By accurately predicting purchasing intentions, we can enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively and efficiently.
